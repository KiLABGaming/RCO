# RCO - Retro Client Review

This GitHub repository serves as a public archive for old, outdated, and discontinued Minecraft hacked clients. These clients are featured in the "Retro Client Review" video series on YouTube, where I take an in-depth look at these legacy clients. 

## ðŸš¨ MALWARE WARNING ðŸš¨

**I want to make it very clear, these clients may not be safe.**  
I **do not** recommend downloading them unless you know what you are doing. Some of these clients have been known to contain malware or other harmful software. Use them at your own risk!

## Installation Instructions
